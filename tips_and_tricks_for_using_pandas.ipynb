    "- Series and DataFrame can represent most of the commonly used data sets. Constructing your data into a Series or a DataFrame allows you to leverage a lot of built-in functionality that Pandas offers \n",
    "- Series and DataFrame support homogeneous and heterogeneous data - meaning they can handle same data types as well as different data types \n",
    "- Series and DataFrame have an index property which defaults to an integer but can be set as desired (imagine time stamps, letters etc.)\n",
    "- Pandas 1.0.0 deprecated the testing module and limited to only assertion functions. While not advisable, if you are using a version < 1.0.0, pandas.util.testing offers close to 30 different built-in functions to whip up different data frames that make it easy to test. You can get the list of possible functions like so \n",
