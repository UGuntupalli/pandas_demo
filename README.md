# pandas_demo
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. This repository is an attempt to build and demonstrate some commonly used features of pandas that make data analysis easy. A lot of the information sourced here is publicly available on the web and is not my own.
